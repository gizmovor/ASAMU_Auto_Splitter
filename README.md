LiveSplit.ASAMU_Load_Remover
=====================

LiveSplit.ASAMU_Load_Remover is a [LiveSplit](http://livesplit.org/) script for A Story About My Uncle.

Features
--------
  * Removes Loads to calculate IGT to make times more fair across machines and runs.(srcom rules are in RTA for now)
  * Auto Start the timer when loading into Sanctuary.
  * Splits when changing chapters/levels and when losing control in Epilogue.

Install
-------
Starting with LiveSplit 1.4, you can download and install LiveSplit.ASAMU automatically from within the Splits Editor with just one click. Just type in "A Story About My Uncle" or "ASAMU" for the game (it should autocomplete the full game name) and click Activate. This downloads LiveSplit.ASAMU_Load_Remover to the Components folder.

Put your starting time at 1:39.29

Configure
---------
Open your Splits Editor and activate the autosplitter. If this is not working, leave it deactivated and manually add it in the Layout Editor. You can configure the settings in whichever editor it has been enabled in.

After configuring everything you'll most likely want to turn on real time as primary timing, so that your splits will run off real time since it's the rule used in srcom. You can do this by right-clicking LiveSplit and going to Compare Against -> Real Time.
